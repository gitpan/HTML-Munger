Description
===========

HTML::Munger is a simple module which allows easy creation of web page
filtering software, such as those listed here:

http://dir.yahoo.com/Entertainment/Humor/By_Topic/Computers_and_Internet/Filters/Web_Based/

It was first written to build the pootifier:

http://pootpoot.com/?pootify

The main task which this module performs is attempting to make all the
relative links on the filtered page absolute, so that images, and hyperlinks
work correctly.  It also makes frames and hyperlinks properly filter back
through the filter.

This leaves two major tasks for the user of HTML::Munger: fetching the
original page, and building a simple munging function.


Prerequisites
=============

You'll need Perl and the HTML::Parser module.

========
